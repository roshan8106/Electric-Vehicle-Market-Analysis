# Electric-Vehicle-Market-Analysis

## About the Project
This Tableau dashboard analyzes electric vehicle (EV) trends in the United States. It shows different EV types, where they are popular, driving ranges, and top models to help understand clean transportation growth.

## What I Did
- Collected and cleaned EV data.
- Created charts showing EV adoption, types, geography, driving range, and popular models.
- Built key metrics like average range and total vehicles.
- Made an interactive dashboard with filters for detailed exploration.
- Published the dashboard publicly on Tableau.

## How I Did It
- Used Tableau to connect and organize multiple data sources.
- Created calculations, charts, and filters.
- Added interactive elements like maps and bar charts.
- Published the final dashboard on Tableau Public.

## Key Terms
- **EV**: Electric Vehicle (powered fully or partly by electricity).
- **BEV**: Battery Electric Vehicle (runs only on batteries, needs charging).
- **HEV**: Hybrid Electric Vehicle (uses gasoline and electric, no plug-in).
- **PHEV**: Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (hybrid that can be charged externally).
- **CFAV**: Clean Fuel Alternative Vehicle (uses cleaner fuels than gasoline).

## Key Insights
- EV adoption in the U.S. is steadily growing.
- BEVs are becoming more popular than hybrids.
- States like California lead in EV registrations.
- BEVs usually have longer driving ranges than hybrids.
- A few models and brands dominate the EV market.
- Clean fuel vehicles are growing but slower than pure EVs.
